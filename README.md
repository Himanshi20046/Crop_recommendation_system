# Crop_recommendation_system
This project is a machine learning-based system that recommends the most suitable crop for cultivation by analyzing various environmental and soil parameters. The system uses a dataset with 2200 entries and 8 columns, including Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) content, as well as temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.
